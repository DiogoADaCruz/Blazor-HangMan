# Blazor-HangMan

Hangman created for fun in Web Assembly using .NET Blazor 

Created to test out Blazor and web assembly. Future updates = maybe. :/

# How To Use
After pulling run 

dotnet run

Goto http://localhost:5001

There you will be met with the game

There will be an array of buttons to guess the word

Hint Blazor is in the word.
